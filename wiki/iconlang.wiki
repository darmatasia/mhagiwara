#summary iconlang - new ideographic characters based on identicon for speed-reading

= Introduction =

What is this? "iconlang" is a new ideographic writing system based on identicon. This maps each English (or any other languages) word into single character, like Chinese, which saves a lot of space and time, making it possible for us to read English sentences very rapidly.

= What's identicon? =

The idea "iconlang" is heavily based on "identicon," which is a graphical representation system of hash values. The original identicon idea is introduced here:

A python implementation of "iconlang" can be found here, which depends on PIL (Python Image Library):

"identicon" algorithm first decodes the input hash value (32 bits) into different bit fragments as below (from LSB to MSB):
